Spatial analysis of tuberculosis in Northwest Ethiopia. Read the details in the published paper `https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30989204/`.

**Descriptive summary statistics** for all districts were computed for all variables and profiling of hotspots of TB. 
**Analysis of variance** was used to profile sociodemographic variables across the four LISA groups (HH, LH, LL and not significant). The Tukey test was performed to adjust for multiple comparisons. Cohen’s d was used to describe the relative strength of
a variable in differentiating LISA groups. 

**Cohen’s d** was used to describe the relative strength of a variable in differentiating LISA groups.

**Classification and Regression Tree (CART)** analyses were used to identify those sociodemographic factors that were the most important in terms of explaining TB clustering
